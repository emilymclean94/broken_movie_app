# StreamVerse

## Description

We wanted to creat an app that allows the user to access movies, rate them, and add them into different list. List being what they want to watch and what they have watched. We wanted the users to have the ability to view other users rated movies. We wanted to create a feed that has their friends and other users rated movies. We wanted a profile dashboard for the user so they can view their bio, saved movie list, and to be watched list. When they click on a friends name it takes them to that friends profile. Each movie can be rated to save and then it can be removed from the saved list and the to be watched list. We wanted to create a goodReads but for movies!
